## Virtualization
**One computer, many operating systems**
- macOS, Windows 11, Linux Ubuntu, all at the same time!

**Separate OS, independent CPU, memory, network, etc**
- but really one computer 

**Host-based virtualization**
- your normal desktop plus others 

**Standalone server that hosts virtual machines**
- enterprise-level 

**Been around since 1967**
- IBM mainframe virtualization 
---
## Legacy software and OS'
**Need to run different application versions on the same system**
- run each application instance in a separate VM

**Application only runs on a previous OS version**
- create a VM with the older OS

## Cross-platform Virtualization 
**Windows / macOS / Linux doesn't do everything**
- Each OS has strengths and weaknesses

**Run different OS' at the same time**
- move between each OS seamlessly
- no rebooting necessary

**Save time and resources**
- one physical computer 
---
## The hypervisor 
**Virtual Machine Manager**
- manages the virtual platform and guest operating systems 

**May require a CPU that supports virtualization**
- can improve performance

**Hardware management**
- CPU 
- Networking
- Security

## Resource requirements 
**CPU Processor Support**
- Intel: Virtualization Technology (VT)
- AMD: AMD-V

**Memory**
- above and beyond host OS requirements 

**Disk space**
- each guest OS has it's own image 

**Network**
- configurable on each guest OS (standalone, NAT, bridged, etc)
- Virtual switch
---
## Sandboxing
**Isolated testing environment**
- no connection to the real world or production system 
- a technological safe space 

**Virtualize development process**
- try some code, break some code, nobody gets hurt

**Additional development features**
- roll back to a previous snapshot 
- run additional systems 
---
## Building the application 
**Develop**
- secure environment 
- writing code 
- developers test in their sandboxes 

**Test**
- a separate virtual environment for testing 
- Still in the development stage 
- all of the pieces are put together 
- does it all work?
---
## Hypervisor security 
**Hypervisor is a sweet spot for the bad guys**
- no significant vulnerabilities yet 

**VM escaping**
- malware recognizes it's on a virtual machine 
- malware compromises the hypervisor 
- malware jumps from one guest OS to another 

**Many hosted services are virtual environments**
- malware on one customer's server can gather information from another 
---
## Guest OS security 
**Every guest is self-contained**
- like a real computer 

**Use traditional security controls**
- host-based firewall 
- anti-virus, anti-spyware 

**Watch out for the rogue Virtual Machines (VMs)**
- the bad guys try to install their own system 
	- you're in big trouble 

**Self-contained VMs provided by 3rd parties can be dangerous**
- you have no idea what's running on there 
---
## Network requirements 
**Most client-side virtual machine managers have their own virtual (internal) networks**

**Shared network address**
- the VM shares the same IP address as the physical host 
- uses a private IP address internally
- uses NAT to convert to the physical host IP

**Bridged network address**
- the VM is a device on the physical network 

**Private address**
- the VM does not communicate outside of the virtual network
