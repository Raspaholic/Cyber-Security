## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
**Sometimes called Hardware as a Service (HaaS)**
- outsource your equipment

- and for the security 

**Your data is out there, but more within your control**

**Web server providers**

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
**On-demand software**
- no local installation 
- why manage your own email distribution? or payroll?

**Central management of data and applications**

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
**No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC**

	- choose carefully 

**Put the building blocs together**
- develop your app from what's available on the platform
