## Port numbers
**Well-known port number**
- Client and server need to match

**Important for firewall rules**
- Port-based security 

**A bit of rote memorization**
- becomes second nature after a while 

**Make sure you know port number, protocol, and how the protocol is used**

---
## FTP - File Transfer Protocol 
**tcp/20 (active mode data), tcp/21 (control)**
- transfers files between systems 

**Authenticates with a username and password**
- some systems use a generic/anonymous login 

**Full-featured functionality**
- List, add, delete, etc. 
---
## SSH - Secure Shell 
**Encrypted communication link - tcp/22**
**Looks and acts the same as Telnet** 

---
## Telnet - Telecommunication Network 
- tcp/23
**Login to devices remotely**
- Console access

**In-the-clear communication**
- not the best choice for production systems 
---
## SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
- Server to server email transfer 
- tcp/25

**Also used to send mail from a device to a mail server**
- commonly configured on mobile devices and email 

**Other protocols are used for clients to receive email**
- IMAP, POP3 
---
## DNS - Domain Name System 
**Converts names to IP addresses** 
- udp/53

**These are very critical resources**
- usually multiple DNS servers are in production 
---
## DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
**Automated configuration of IP address, subnet mask and other options**
- udp/67
- udp/68
- Requires a DHCP server 
	- Server, appliance, integrated into a SOHO router, etc

**Dynamic / pooled**
- IP addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool 
- Each system is given a lease and must renew at set intervals

**DHCP reservation**
- addresses are assigned by MAC address in the DHCP server 
- manage addresses from one location 
---
## HTTP and HTTPS
![[Pasted image 20250619194957.png]]
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
- communication in the browser 
- and by other applications 

**In the clear or encrypted**
- supported by nearly all web servers and clients 
---
## POP3 / IMAP 
**Receive emails from an email server**
- Authenticate and transfer 

**POP3 - Post office Protocol version 3**
- tcp/110 
- Basic mail transfer functionality 

**IMAP4 - Internet Message Access Protocol v4**
- tcp/143 
- Includes management of email inbox from multiple clients 
---
## SMB - Server Message Block 
**Protocol used by Microsoft Windows**
- File sharing, printer sharing 
- also called CIFS (Common Internet File System)

**Using NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Network Basic Input/Output System)**
- udp/137 - NetBIOS name services (nbname)
- tcp/139 - NetBIOS session service (nbsession)

**Direct over tcp/445 (NetBIOS-less)**
- Direct SMB communication over TCP without the NetBIOS transport 
---
## SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol 
**Gather statistics from network devices**
- Queries: udp/161 
- Traps: udp/162 

**v1 - The original**
- Structured tables 
- In-the-clear 

**v2 - A good step ahead**
- Data type enhancements
- Bulk transfers
- Still in-the-clear 

**v3 - A secure standard**
- Message integrity 
- Authentication
- Encryption 
---
## LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
- tcp/389

**Store and retrieve information in a network directory**
- commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory 
---
## RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol 
- Share a desktop from a remote location over tcp/3389
- Remote Desktop Services on many Windows versions 
- Can connect to an entire desktop or just an application 
- Clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix, iPhone, Android, and others
