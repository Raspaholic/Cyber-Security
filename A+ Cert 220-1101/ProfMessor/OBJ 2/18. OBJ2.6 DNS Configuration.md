## Domain Name System (DNS)
**Translates human-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses**
- only need to remember URL's 

**Hierarchical**
- follow the path 

**Distributed Database**
- many DNS servers 
- 13 root server clusters (Over 1,000 actual servers)
- Hundreds of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) 
	- .com
	- .org
	- .net
- over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs)
	- .us
	- .ca
	- .uk

## DNS records 
**Resource Records (RR)**
- the database records of domain name services 

**Over 30 record types**
- IP addresses 
- certificates 
- host alias names 

**THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL CONFIGURATIONS**
- make sure to check your settings 
- backup 
- TEST
---
## Address records (A) (AAAA)
**Defines the IP address of a host**
- this is the most popular query

**A records are for IPv4 addresses**
- Modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution

**AAAA records are for IPv6 addresses**
- the same DNS server, different records

## Mail Exchanger (MX) record 
**Determines the host name for the mail server**
- IS NOT an IP address; it's a NAME

## Text (TXT) records 
**Human-readable text information**
- useful public information 
- originally designed for informal information 

**Can be used for verification purposes**
- if you have access to the DNS, you must be the Administrator of the domain name 

**Commonly used for email security**
- external email servers validate information from your DNS

## Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
**SPF protocol**
- a list of all servers authorized to send emails for this domain 
- prevent mail spoofing
- mail servers perform a check to see if incoming mail truly did come from an authorized host

## Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
**Digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail**
- validated by mail servers, not usually seen by the end user 
- the public key is in the DKIM TXT record

## DMARC
**Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)**
- prevent unauthorized email use (spoofing)
- an extension of SPF and DKIM

**You decide what external email servers should do with emails that don't validate through SPF or DKIM**
- that policy is written into a DMARC TXT record 
- accept all, send to spam, or reject the email 
- compliance reports can be sent to the email administrator
