## Cable crimpers
**"Pinch" the connector onto a wire**
- Coaxial, twisted pair (TP), fiber

**Connect the modular connector to the Ethernet cable**
- The final step of the process 

**Metal prongs are pushed through the insulation**
- the plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath

## Crimping best practices
**Get a good crimper**
- AND a good pair of electrician's scissors / cable snips 
- and a good wire stripper 

**Make sure you use the correct modular connectors**
- differences between wire types 

**Practice, practice, practice**
- won't take long to become proficient

## WiFi analyzer 
**Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor**
- Everyone "hears" everything 

**Purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on**
- Specializes in 802.11 analysis

**Identify errors and interference**
- Validate antenna location and installation

## Tone generator
**Toner probe**
- Where does that wire go?
- Follow the tone 

**Tone generator**
- puts an analog sound on the wire 

**Inductive probe**
- doesn't need to touch the copper 
- Hear through a small speaker 
### Using the tone generator and probe
**Easy wire tracing**
- even in complex environments

**Connect the tone generator to the wire**
- Modular jack 
- Coax 
- Punch down connectors 

**Use the probe to locate the sound**
- The two-tone sound is easy to find 
---
## Punch down tool 
**"Punch" a wire into a wiring block**
- 66 block, 110 block, and others 

**Can be tedious**
- Every wire must be individually punched 

**Trims the wires during the punch**
- very efficient process 
### Punch-down best practices 
**Organization is key**
- lots of wires 
- cable management 

**Maintain your twists**
- your Category 6A cable will thank you later 

**Document everything**
- Written documentation 
- Tags
- Graffiti
---
## Cable testers 
**Relatively simple**
- Continuity test 
- A simple wire map

**Can identify missing pins**
- or crossed wires 

**Not usually used for frequency testing**
- Crosstalk, signal loss, etc 
---
## Loopback plugs 
**Useful for testing physical ports**
- or fooling your applications 

**Serial / RS-232 (9 pin or 25 pin)**

**Network Connections**
- Ethernet, T1, Fiber 

**These are not cross-over cables**

## Taps and port mirrors 
**Intercept network traffic**
- send a copy to a packet capture device 

**Physical taps**
- disconnect the link, put a tap in the middle 
- can be an active or passive tap 

**Port mirror**
- Port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port ANalyzer)
- Software-based tap 
- Limited functionality, but can work well in a pinch
