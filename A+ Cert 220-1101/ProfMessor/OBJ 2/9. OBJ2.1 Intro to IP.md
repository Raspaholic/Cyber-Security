## A series of "moving vans"
**Efficiently move large amounts of data**
- use a shipping truck 

**The network topology is the road**
- Ethernet, DSL, cable system 

**The truck is the Internet Protocol (IP)**
- we've designed the roads for this truck 

**The "boxes" hold your data**
- boxes of TCP and UDP 

**Inside the boxes are more things**
- Application information

## IP - Internet Protocol 
![[Pasted image 20250619180036.png]]

---
## TCP and UDP
**Transported inside of IP**
- encapsulated by the IP protocol 

**2 ways to move data from place to place**
- different features for different applications 

**OSI Layer 4**
- the transport layer 

**Multiplexing**
- use many different applications at the same time 
- TCP and UDP 
---
## TCP - Transmission Control Protocol 
![[Pasted image 20250619180235.png]]
**Connection-oriented**
- a formal connection setup and close 

**"Reliable" delivery**
- recovery from errors 
- can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions 

**Flow control**
- the receiver can manage how much data is sent 
---
### Communication using TCP
**Connection-oriented protocols prefer a "return receipt"**
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
- SSH (Secure Shell)

**The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data**
- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
- The application has one job 
---
## UDP - User Datagram Protocol 
![[Pasted image 20250619180405.png]]
**Connectionless**
- no formal open or close to the connection 

**"Unreliable" delivery**
- no error recovery 
- no reordering of data or retransmissions 

**No flow control**
- sender determines the amount of data transmitted 
### Why would you ever use UDP?
**Real-time communication**
- no way to stop and resend the data 
- time doesn't stop for your network 

**Connectionless protocols**
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

**The data might not get through**
- The application keeps track and decides what to do 
- It might not do anything 
---
## Speedy Delivery 
**The IP delivery "truck drivers" from 1 (IP) address to another (IP) address**
- every house has an address, every computer has an IP address 

**"Boxes" arrive at the house / IP address**
- where do the boxes go?
	- each box has a "room name"

**Port is written on the outside of the box**
- drop the box into the right room 
---
## Lots of Ports 
**IPv4 sockets**
- Server IP address, protocol, server application port number 
- Client IP address, protocol, client port number 

**Non-ephemeral ports - permanent port numbers**
- ports 0 through 1,023
- usually on a server or service 

**Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers**
- Ports 1,024 through 65,535
- Determined in real-time by the client 
---
## Port Numbers 
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535
- Most servers (services) use non-ephemeral (not-temporary) port numbers 
	- isn't always the case, it's just a NUMBER 
- Port numbers are for communication, not security 
- Service port numbers need to be "well known"
- TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers 
---
## Ports on the Network 
![[Pasted image 20250619181728.png]]
- Web server - tcp/80
- VoIP server - udp/5004
- Email server - tcp/143
