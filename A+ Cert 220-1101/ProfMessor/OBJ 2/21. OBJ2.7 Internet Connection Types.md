## Satellite Networking
**Communication to a satellite**
- Non-terrestrial communication 

**High cost relative to terrestrial networking**
- 50 Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up are common 
- Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites 

**High latency**
- 250 ms up, 250 ms down
- Starlink advertises 40 ms and is working on 20 ms 

**High frequencies - 2 GHz**
- Line of Sight (LoS), rain fade 
---
## Fiber 
**High speed data communication**
- frequencies of light 

**Higher installation cost than copper**
- Equipment is more costly 
- More difficult to repair 
- Communicate over long distances

**Large installation in the WAN core**
- Supports very high data rates 
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing

**Fiber is slowly approaching the premises**
- business and home use 
---
## Cable broadband
**Broadband**
- transmission across multiple frequencies 
- different traffic types 

**Data on the "cable" network**
- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)

**High-speed networking**
- 50 Mbit/s through 1,000+ Mbit/s are common 

**Multiple services**
- Data, voice, video
---
## DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
**ADSL - Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)**
- uses telephone lines

**Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)**
- 200 Mbit/s downstream / 20 Mbit/s upstream are common 
- ~10,000 foot limitation from the Central Office (CO)
- Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO 
---
## Cellular Networks 
**Mobile devices**
- "Cell" phones

**Separate land into "cells"**
- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies 

**Tethering**
- turn your phone into a wireless router 

**Mobile hotspot**
- standalone devices 
- use your phone for other things 
---
## WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider)
**Wireless Internet Service Provider**
- Terrestrial internet access using wireless 

**Connect rural or remote locations**
- internet access for everyone 

**Many different deployment technologies**
- Meshed 802.11
- 5G home internet 
- Proprietary wireless 

**Need an outdoor antenna**
- Speeds can range from ~ 10 to 1,000 megabits per second
