## DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
**IPv4 address configuration used to be manual**
- IP address 
- Subnet mask 
- Gateway
- DNS servers
- NTP servers, etc

**October 1993: the Bootstrap Protocol**
- BOOTP 

**BOOTP didn't automatically define everything**
- some manual configurations were still required 
- BOOTP also didn't know when an IP address might be available again 

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**
- Initially released in 1997, updated through the years 
- Provides automatic address / IP configuration for almost all devices 
### DHCP Process 
**DORA**
- a 4 step process 

1 **Discover**
- find a DHCP server 

2 **Offer**
- get an offer 

3 **Request**
- lock in the offer 

4 **Acknowledge**
- DHCP server confirmation

## Turning dynamic into static 
**DHCP assigns an IP address from the first available from a large pool of addresses**
- your IP address will occasionally change 

**You may not want your IP address to change**
- Server, printer, or personal preference 

**Disable DHCP on the device**
- Configure the IP address information manually
- Requires additional administration 

**Better: Configure an IP reservation on the DHCP server**
- Associate a specific MAC address with an IP address 
---
## Avoid manual configurations 
**No DHCP server reservation**
- you configure the IP address manually 

**Difficult to change later**
- you must visit the device again 

**a DHCP reservation is preferable**
- change the IP address from the DHCP server 
---
## Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
**a Link-local Address**
- no forwarding by routers 

**IETF has reserved 169.254.0.0 through 169.254.255.255**
- First and last 256 addresses are reserved 
- Functional block of 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255 

**Automatically assigned**
- uses ARP to confirm the address isn't currently in use
