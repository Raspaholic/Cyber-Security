## SDN (Software Defined Networking)
**Networking devices have different functional planes of operation**
- Data, control, management planes 

**Split the functions into separate logical units**
- Extend the functionality and management of a single device 
- Perfectly built for the cloud 

**Infrastructure layer / Data plane**
- Process the network frames and packets 
- Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT

**Control layer / Control plane**
- manages the actions of the data plane 
- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables 
- Dynamic routing protocol updates 

**Application layer / Management plane**
- Configure and manage the device 
- SSH, browser, API
