# Wireless standards 
**Wireless networking (802.11)**
- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)

**Many updates over time**
- Check with IEEE for the latest 

**The WiFi trademark**
- WiFi Alliance handles interoperability testing 
---
## 802.11a
**One of the original 802.11 wireless standards**
- October 1999

**Operates in the 5 GHz range**
- or other frequencies with special licensing 

**54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)**

**Smaller range than 802.11b**
- higher frequency is absorbed by objects in the way

**Not commonly seen today** 

---
## 802.11b 
**Also an original 802.11 standard**
- Oct 1999

**Operates in the 2.4 GHz range**

**11 megabits per second (Mbit/s)**

**Better range than 802.11a**
- less absorption problems

**More frequency conflict**
- baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth 

**Not commonly seen today**

---
## 802.11g
**an "upgrade" to 802.11b**
- June 2003

**Operates in the 2.4 GHz range**

**54 megabits per second (Mbit/s)**
- similar to 802.11a 

**Backwards-compatible with 802.11b**

**same 2.4 GHz frequency conflict problems as 802.11b** 

---
## 802.11n (WiFi 4)
**update to 802.11g, 802.11b, 802.11a**
- Oct 2009 

**Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz**
- 40 MHz channel widths 

**600 megabits per second (Mbit/s)
- 40 MHz mode and 4 antennas 

**802.11n uses MIMO**
- Multiple-input multiple-output 
- Multiple transmit and receive antennas 
---
## 802.11ac (WiFi 5)
**Approved in Jan 2014**
- significant improvements over 802.11n 

**Operates in the 5 GHz band**
- less crowded, more frequencies (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)

**Increased channel bonding**
- larger bandwidth usage 

**Denser signaling modulation**
- faster data transfers 

**Eight MU-MIMO downlink streams**
- twice as many streams as 802.11n 
- nearly 7 gigabits per second 
---
## 802.11ax (WiFi 6)
**Approved in Feb 2021**
- successor to 802.11ac/WiFi 5

**Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz**
- 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channel widths 

**1,201 megabits per second per channel**
- relatively small increase in throughput 
- 8 Bi-directional MU-MIMO streams 

**Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)**
- works similar to cellular communication 
- improves high-density installations

## Long-range Fixed Wireless 
**Wireless Access Point (WAP) in a house with *Stock Antennas***
- might get range of 40 to 50 meters 

**Try connecting 2 buildings located miles from each other**
- Fixed directional antennas and increased signal strength 

**Outdoors**
- Minimal signal absorption or bounce 

**Directional Antennas**
- Focused, point-to-point connection 

**Wireless regulations are complex**
- refer to your country's regulatory agency

**Frequency use**
- unlicensed 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies 
- additional frequencies may be available
- additional licensing may be required 

**Signal strength**
- Indoor and outdoor power is usually regulated 

**Outdoor antenna installation is not trivial**
- get an expert, be safe 
---
## RFID (Radio-frequency Identification)
**RFID is everywhere**
- Access badges 
- Inventory/Assembly line tracking 
- Pet/Animal identification 
- Anything that needs to be tracked 

**Radar technology**
- Radio energy transmitted to the tag 
- RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back 
- Bi-directional communication 
- Some tag formats can be active/powered 
---
## NFC (Near Field Communication)
**Two-way wireless communication**
- Builds on RFID, which is mostly one-way 

**Payment systems**
- Major credit cards 
- Online wallets 

**Bootstrap for other wireless**
- NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing 

**Access token, identity "card"**
- Short range with encryption support
