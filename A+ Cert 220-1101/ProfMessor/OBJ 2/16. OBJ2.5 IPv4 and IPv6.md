## IP Addressing
**IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything we do**
- Included in almost all configurations 

**IPv6 is now part of all major OS'**
- and the backbone of our internet infrastructure 
---
## IPv4 Addresses 
**Internet Protocol version 4**
- OSI Layer 3 address

- since 1 Byte is 8 Bits: max decimal value for each byte is 255 
---
## IPv6 Addresses 
**Internet Protocol v6 - 128-bit address**
- 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (340 undecillion)

- your DNS is very important!
- First 64 bits is generally the network prefix (/64)
- Last 64 bits is then the host network address

## Networking with IPv4
**IP Address: e.g. 192.168.1.165**
- every device needs a unique IP address 

**Subnet mask: e.g. 255.255.255.0**
- Used by the local device to determine what subnet it's on 
	- the subnet mask isn't (usually) transmitted across the network 
	- you'll ask for the subnet mask all the time ("what's the subnet mask of this network?")

**Default gateway: e.g. 192.168.1.1**
- the router that allows you to communicate outside of your local subnet 
- the default gateway must be an IP address on the Local Subnet

## DNS Servers 
**We remember names**
- professermesser.com
- google.com
- youtube.com

**Internet routers don't know names**
- Routers only know IP addresses 

**Something has to translate between names and IP addresses**
- Domain Name Services 

**You configure 2 DNS servers in your IP configuration**
- that's how important it is
