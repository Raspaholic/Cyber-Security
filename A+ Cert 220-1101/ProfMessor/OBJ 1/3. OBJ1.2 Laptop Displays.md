## Portable LCD
Liquid Crystal Display
- light shines through liquid crystals 

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">ADVANTAGES</span> 
- lightweight 
- relatively low power
- relatively inexpensive 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">DISADVANTAGES</span> 
- black levels are a challenge 
- Requires separate backlight 
- Florescent, LED, etc
- lights are difficult to replace 
## LCD Technologies 
#### TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
- original LCD technology 
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Fast response times (**gaming!**)</span> 
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Poor viewing angles - color shifts </span> 
#### IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
- excellent color representation 
- more expensive to produce than TN
#### VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
- good compromise between TN and IPS 
- Good color representation 
- Slower response times than TN 
## OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
Organic Light Emitting Diode 
- organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current 

Thinner and lighter 
- flexible and mobile-- no glass needed 

No backlight 
- the organic compound provides the light 

Tablets, phones, smart watches 
- very accurate color representation 
- a bit higher cost than LCD 
## Wi-Fi antennas 
Multiple antennas 
- WiFi main and aux 
- Bluetooth 

Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen
- physically reaches a higher/more WiFi accessible point 
## Webcam 
Video capture
- built-in camera and microphone 

Usually includes both audio and video 
- specialized drivers and software 
## Microphone 
 Built-in to the laptop display 
 - useful for video calls 

Not good for non-casual use 
- Analog or USB microphones can help 
## Fluorescent vs LED backlighting 
**CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp**
- higher voltage and power needed
- added thickness to the display 
- no longer a common backlight 
- older laptops will use these 

LED-backlit LCD display 
- backlight is LEDs instead of fluorescent 
- LEDs around the edge of the screen 
- an array of LEDs behind the screen 
- the latest laptops are LED-backlit 
## Backlight and inverter 
LCD displays need a backlight 
- Fluorescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes 

Some laptops have inverters 
- turn DC into AC

Verify backlight
- look closely 
- use a flashlight 

May need to replace the LCD inverter or display 
- choose carefully 
## Digitizer 
Use a pen-like device as input 
- stylus input 
- useful for graphical input 

Used commonly on laptop/tablets 
- or hybrid devices 
## Touchscreen 
Merge laptop and tablet input 
- digitizer responds to touch 
- no keyboard required 
	- often still available 

Many options for input 
- use the best one for the job
