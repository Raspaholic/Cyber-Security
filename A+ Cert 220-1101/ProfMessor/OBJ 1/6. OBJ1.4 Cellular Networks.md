## Cellular Networks 
Mobile Devices
- "Cell" phones

Separate land into "cells"
- antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies 

2G networks 
- GSM - **Global System for Mobile Communications**
- CDMA - **Code Division Multiple Access**

Poor data support 
- Originally used circuit-switching 
- Minor upgrades for some packet-switching 
---
## GSM Global System for Mobile Communications 
- mobile networking standard 

90% of the market
- originally an EU standard 
- worldwide coverage 

Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the US
- move your SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone 

Original GSM standard used multiplexing
- everyone gets a little slice of time 
---
## CDMA Code Division Multiple Access 
- everyone communicates at the same time 
- each call uses a different code 
- the codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side 

Used by Verizon and Sprint
- handsets are controlled by the network provider 
- not much adoption elsewhere 
---
## 3G Technology 
3rd Generation 
- introduced in 1998

Upgraded data connectivity over 2G
- incremental 3G updates improved speeds 
- usually several megabits per second 

Bandwidth improvement allowed new functionallity
- GPS
- Mobile television 
- Video on demand 
---
## 4G and LTE 
Long Term Evolution (LTE)
- a "4G" technology 
- converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers)
- based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
- standard supports download rates of 150 Mbit/s

LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
- standard supports download rates of 300 Mbit/s 
---
## 5G 
Fifth Generation cellular networking 
- launched worldwide in 2020 

Significant performance improvements 
- at higher frequencies 
- eventually 10 Gigabits per second 
- slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s 

Significant IoT impact 
- bandwidth becomes less of a constraint 
- larger data transfers 
- faster monitoring and notification 
- additional cloud processing 
---
## Updates 
PRL Updates 
- Preferred Roaming List 
- CDMA networks (i.e. Verizon, Sprint)

Allows your phone to connect to the right tower 
- can be updated over the air (OTA)
---
## Hotspot 
turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot 
- your own personal wireless router 
- extend the cellular data network to all of your devices

Dependent on phone type and provider 
- may require additional charges and data costs
