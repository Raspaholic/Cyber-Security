Engineered to precise specifications 
- a challenging repair

Some laptops are easier to fix than others

Understand the process
- details will vary between laptop manufacturers 

## Laptop Batteries
The power source when unplugged
- may be easily replaced or require a teardown
- five minutes vs. 1 hour

Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo) are common 
- No "memory effect"
- charging the battery diminishes capacity

Different form factor for each laptop 
- battery types and styles can vary
- battery technology is changing constantly 
## Laptop Keyboard
The most-used component of the laptop 
- can be easy to replace 
- a few screws and a single ribbon cable 
	- may not always be this easy 

Connect an external USB keyboard 
- not very portable, works in a pinch 
## Laptop Keys & Repair/Replace
Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap 
- this can be a <u>delicate</u> procedure 

Check with manufacturers instructions
- very easy to accidentally break the key cap or the components underneath 
## Laptop Memory 
**Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)**

Memory used in laptops and mobile devices
- often easy to install & replace 

Some laptop memory is soldered to the system motherboard 
- no upgrade available 
- requires a full system board replacement 
## Laptop Storage 
Magnetic disk
- traditional spinning drive platters 
- 2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops)

SSD (Solid-state drive)
- all memory, no moving parts
- no SATA data or power cables 
- easy to install and replace 
### Replacing Laptop Storage 
All internal 
- open a cover on the back 
- open the entire laptop 

Can be very modular
- 2 screws and the drive slides out 

M.2 drives are even easier 
- 1 screw 
- similar to RAM installation 

# Migrating from HDD to SSD
An impressive upgrade 
- move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory 
- almost like getting a new laptop 

Install an OS on the SSD
- move user documents between drives 
- install any required applications 
- can be time consuming 

Image/Clone the HDD
- no OS installation required 
- move everything from one to the other 

Imaging software needed 
- sometimes included with the SSD 
- many commercial and open source options 

Create an image file
- one drive at a time 

Drive-to-drive image 
- image directly from one drive to the other 

## 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth 
Wireless network connectivity 
- connect without wires 

802.11 
- Local area network (LAN)
- High speed 
- Internet access 

Bluetooth 
- Personal area network (PAN)
- short range 
- connect peripherals and other nearby devices 
## Biometrics 
Sign in or unlock your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition 
- something you are 

Requires additional configuration in the OS
- hardware required for most options 

Relatively secure 
- faces and fingerprints are quite unique 
## Near-field communication (NFC)
Short-distance networking
- 4 centimeters or less
- data transfers or authentication 

Common on mobile phones and smart watches
- payment method on your wrist

Use it for authentication without typing a password
- Hospital workstations 
- Warehouses 
- Manufacturing
