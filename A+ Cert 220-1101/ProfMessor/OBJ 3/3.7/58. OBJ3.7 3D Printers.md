## 3D Printers
**"Print" in three dimensions**
- create a 3D item based on an electronic model 

**Additive manufacturing**
- build in layers to create the object 
- no machining process required

**Rapid prototyping**
- design and create relatively quickly and inexpensively

**Deploy designs anywhere in the world**
- or into space

## Filament printing
**Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)**
- melt filament to print 3D objects 
- this is probably the printing type you've seen

**Print a layer, move up, print another layer**
- watch the printer create the object 

**Good all-around printer**
- larger print bed than resin printers 
- easy to manage filament 
- minimum of mess 
- fewer disposal issues 
---
## Resin printing 
**Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printing**
- smooth and finely detailed 3D prints 

**Resin is hardened using a light source**
- ultraviolet light or a laser 
- layers are added to the bottom 
- entire print hangs from the build platform

**Resin must be handled properly**
- wear protective gear 
- take unused resin to your local hazardous materials disposal

## The print bed 
**A flat adhesive surface**
- the foundation of a 3D print 
- everything builds on that first layer 

**Needs to be level and clean**
- prints "stick" to the bed 

**Filament printing**
- the print bed is the printing surface 
- many different print bed options 

**Resin printing**
- the "bed" is the location where the resin is hardened by the UV light
