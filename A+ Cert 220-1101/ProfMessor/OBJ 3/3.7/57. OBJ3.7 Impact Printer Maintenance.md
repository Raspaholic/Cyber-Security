## Printer ribbon replacement
**Single ribbon**
- Self-contained
- one long circle

**Replaces when ink becomes too light**
- ink is eventually consumed 

**Designed to be modular**
- replace in less than a minute
---
## Print head replacement 
**Takes a lot of abuse**
- directly hits the ribbon and paper 

**Gets hot**
- watch your fingers

**Another modular part**
- look for a release lever or bar

**Replace with the ribbon for the best effect**
- the output should look perfect
---
## Replacing paper 
**Not as easy as a laser printer**
- paper must feed perfectly into holes 
	- tractor feed

**Forms must be positioned correctly**
- text needs to fit a predefined space 

**Paper must feed without constraint**
- make sure nothing is in the way
