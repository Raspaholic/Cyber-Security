## Laser printer
**Combine a laser, high voltage, charged ions, powdered ink, heat, and paper**

**Very high quality**

**Fast printing speeds**

**Very complex**
- many moving parts
- requires on-printer memory
- messy on the inside

## Duplexing Assembly 
**Printers usually print on a single side**
- not both sides simultaneously

**Printing on both sides is a two step process**
- print side 1, print side 2

**You need mechanisms to "flip" the page**
- automatically 

**Can be built-in to the printer**
- or available as an add-on
