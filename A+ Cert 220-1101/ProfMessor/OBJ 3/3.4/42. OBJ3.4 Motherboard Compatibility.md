## Intel and AMD
**Two solid CPU manufacturers**
- the differences are subtle

**Cost**
- AMD tends to be a bit less expensive

**Different sockets**
- the motherboard is designed for a particular CPU

**Choosing a side**
- Historically, AMD is value and Intel is performance
- this is a dynamic technology segment

## Server motherboards
**Multisocket**
- supports multiple physical CPU packages
- Split the load

**Memory slots**
- supports 4+ modules

**Expansion slots**
- many slots and different sizes

**Overall size**
- designed for a rack-mounted system
- larger ATX-sized system

## Desktop motherboards 
**Can range from full-size motherboards to compact or monitor-only systems**
- we can do a lot with increasingly smaller systems 

**Single CPU**
- reduces cost and complexity

**Memory slots**
- usually 2 or 4

**Expansion slots**
- may have limited options

## Mobile motherboards 
**Laptops**
- small and light

**CPUs**
- limited in speed 
- thermal throttling

**Limited system modification**
- memory, CPU, functionality

**Portability**
- smaller devices
- low power consumption
---
## System board
**Proprietary**
- built to fit

**Replacement isn't easy**
- swap the entire board 
- most components are on the system board
