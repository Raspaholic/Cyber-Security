## The secret button(s)
**Launching the system setup**
- Del, F1, F2, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Alt-S

**Hyper-V (Windows 8 / 10 / 11)**
- turn Windows features ON and OFF

**VMware Workstation Player**
- http://www.vmware.com/products/player/

**But not VirtualBox**
- http://www.virtualbox.org

**Many simulators online**
- search for "UEFI BIOS simulator"

## Fast startup
**Windows 8, 10, and 11**
- doesn't actually shutdown completely
- starts up so quickly, you can't open the BIOS configuration 

**From the Windows desktop**
- Hold down SHIFT when clicking Restart
- Settings>Update & Security>Recovery>Advanced startup>Restart now
- System Configuration (msconfig)

**Interrupt normal boot 3 times**
- presents the boot option screen 
---
## Important tips
**Make a backup of your BIOS configuration**
- write detailed notes
- take a picture

**Don't make a change unless you're certain of the setting**
- it's difficult to leave it alone 

**BACKUP**
- it can save a lot of time 
---
## Boot options
**What happens when you power on?**
- the BIOS knows

**Disable hardware**
- unavailable to the OS

**Modify the boot order**
- which boots first?
- move to the next in order 
- USB drive, SSD, hard drive 
---
## USB permissions
**A security challenge**
- very small storage devices 
- very large capacities 

**USB connections**
- convenient 
- high speed 

**US Department of Defense banned USB flash media for 15 months in 2008**
- SillyFDC worm
---
## Fans
**Computing power creates heat**
- a lot of heat

**Many different cooling fans**
- CPU fan 
- chassis fans

**Motherboards often include an integrated fan controller**
- and temperature sensors
- the motherboard increases and decreases the fan speeds

## Secure Boot 
**Malicious software can "own" your system**
- malicious drivers or OS software 

**Secure boot**
- part of the UEFI specification

**Digitally sign known-good software**
- Cryptographically secure 
- Software won't run without the proper signature

**Support in many different OS'**
- Windows and Linux support

## UEFI BIOS Secure Boot 
**UEFI BIOS protections**
- BIOS includes the manufacturer's public key
- Digital signature is checked during a BIOS update 
- BIOS prevents unauthorized writes to the flash 

**Secure Boot verifies the bootloader**
- checks the OS bootloader's digital signature 
- Bootloader must be signed with a trusted certificate 
- or a manually approved digital signature 
---
## Boot password management
**BIOS Password / User Password**
- system won't start 
- need the password to start the OS

**Supervisor Password**
- restrict BIOS changes 
- must use supervisor password to change any BIOS configurations 

**Remember your password!**
- must reset the BIOS to recover

---
## Clearing a boot password 
**Store the BIOS configuration**
- your settings 

**Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)**
- a type of memory
- may be backed up with a battery

**Usually flash memory these days**
- easily stored and accessed

**Reset with a jumper**
- short (connect) two pins on the motherboard 
- CLRTC - CLEAR REAL TIME CLOCK

## The "CMOS" battery
**Not needed for today's flash-based storage**
- maintains older BIOS configurations 
- may only be used to maintain date/time 

**a bad battery will require a BIOS configuration or date/time config on every boot**

**On older systems, can reset the BIOS configuration by removing the battery**
- newer computers use a jumper

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
**a specification for cryptographic functions**
- hardware to help with encryption functions 

**Cryptographic processor**
- random number generator 
- key generators

**Persistent memory**
- comes with unique keys burned in during production 

**Versatile memory**
- storage keys
- hardware configuration information 

**Password protected**
- no dictionary attacks

## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
**Often used in large environments**
- clusters, redundant power 

**High-end cryptographic hardware**
- plug-in card or separate hardware device 

**Key backup**
- secured storage for servers 
- Lightweight HSMs for personal use (smart card, USB, flash memory)

**Cryptographic accelerators**
- offload that CPU overhead from other devices
