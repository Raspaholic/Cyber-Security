## Case fans
**Cool air is pulled through a PC**
- always check for good airflow

**Motherboard layout becomes important**

**Component location is key**
- devices, wiring, power 

**Many different sizes and styles**
- and volume levels

## On-board fans
**Designed to cool an entire adapter card**

**Can be bulky**
- may take additional adapter card space 

**Usually seen on high-end graphics cards**

## Fan specifications 
**Standard sizes**
- 80 mm
- 120 mm 
- 200 mm, etc

**Different speeds**
- variable speed 

**Different noise levels**
- not all fans sound the same

## Fanless / passive cooling 
**No fans, no noise**
- silent operation 

**Specialized functions**
- video servers, TV set top box, satellite receiver, media server 

**Functions are very controlled**
- carefully measured thermal tests

**Low-power components**
- heat sinks

## Thermal paste 
**Thermal grease, conductive grease**
- Thermally conductive adhesive

**Place between the heat sink and the component**
- improves thermal conductivity
- moves the heat away from the component 

**A little bit goes a long way**
- Pea-sized application

## Thermal pad 
**Conduct heat without the mess**
- Cut to the size and install 

**Easy to use**
- won't leak and damage components 

**Almost as effective as thermal paste**
- but still very good 

**Not reusable**
- remove and replace

## Liquid cooling 
**Coolant is circulated through a computer**
- not a new concept
- Automobiles, mainframe computers 

**High-end systems**

**Gaming, graphics**

**Overclocking**
