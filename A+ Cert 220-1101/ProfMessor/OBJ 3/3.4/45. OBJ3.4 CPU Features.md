## Operating System Technologies
**32-bit vs. 64-bit**
- processor specific

**32-bit processors can store**
- 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 values 

**64-bit processors can store**
- 2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values 
- 4 GB vs. 17 billion GB
- the OS has a maximum supported value

## Operating System technologies 
**Hardware drivers are specific to the OS version**
- (32-bit (x86), 64-bit (x64)

**32-bit OS cannot run 64-bit apps**
- but 64-bit OS can run 32-bit apps

**Apps in a 64-bit Windows OS**
- 32-bit apps: \Program Files (x86)
- 64-bit apps: \Program Files

## Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)
ARM x86
**CPU architecture developed by ARM Ltd.**
- they design the chip, others license and build 

**Simplified instruction set**
- efficient and fast processing 
- less power 
- less heat

**Traditionally used for mobile and IoT devices**
- the lines are constantly blurring
---
## Processor cores 
**Dual-core / Quad-core / Octa-core / Multi-core**
- and more all the time

**Multiple cores**
- each core has its own cache
- the entire chip may have a shared cache

## Multithreading
**Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT)**

**One CPU, acts like 2**

**Doesn't actually work as fast as 2**
- 15% to 30% performance improvement

**OS must be written for HTT**
- Windows XP and later (any modern OS)

## Virtualization Support 
**Run other OS' within a single hardware platform**
- multiple operating systems share physical hardware components

**Virtualization in software was limited**
- performance and hardware management challenges

**Virtualization added to the processor**
- hardware is faster and easier to manage 
- Intel Virtualization Technology (VT)
- AMD Virtualization (AMD-V)
