## A computer bus
**Communication path**
- a city of technology

**Internal PC growth**
- independent pathways

**System expansion**
- additional capabilities

## Conventional PCI
**Peripheral Component Interconnect**
- Nobody ever calls it that 
- created in 1994

**Many expansion slots**
- 32-bit and 64-bit bus width 
- Parallel communication 

**A common expansion interface on previous computer generations**
- PCI Express is the newer technology

## PCI Express
**AKA as PCIe**
- replaces the older PCI standard 

**Communicates serially**
- unidirectional serial "lanes"
- slower devices don't slow down everyone

**1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 full-duplex lanes**
- x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, x32
- "x" is pronounced "by" ("by 4", "by 16")
