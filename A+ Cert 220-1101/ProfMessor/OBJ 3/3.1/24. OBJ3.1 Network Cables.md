## The importance of cable
**Fundamental to network communication**
- Incredibly important foundation

**Usually only get 1 good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure**
- Make it good!!

**The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables**
- It has to plug in somewhere 
---
## Twisted Pair (TP) copper cabling 
**Balanced pair operation**
- 2 wires with equal and opposite signals 
- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-

**The twist is the secret!**
- Keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference
- the opposite signals are compared on the other end

**Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates**

---
## Coaxial cables 
**2 or more forms share a common axis**

**RG-6 used in television/digital cable**
- and high-speed Internet over cable

## No plenum

## Plenum 
![[Pasted image 20250705192610.png]]
**Plenum space**
- Building air circulation 
- Heating and AC system

**Concerns in the case of a fire**
- Smoke and toxic fumes 

**Worst-case planning**
- Important concerns for any structure 
---
## Plenum-rated cable 
**Traditional cable jacket**
- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

**Fire-rated cable jacket**
- Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

**Plenum-rated cable may not be as flexible**
- May not have the same bend radius

**Worst-case planning**
- Important concerns for any structure 
---
## Unshielded and shielded cable 
**UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)**
- No additional shielding 
- The most common twisted pair cabling 

![[Pasted image 20250705193027.png]]

**STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)**
- Additional shielding protects against interference 
- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable 
- Requires the cable to be grounded 

![[Pasted image 20250705193119.png]]

**Abbreviations**
- U = ==Unshielded==
- S = ==Braided shielding==
- F = ==Foil shielding==

**(Overall cable) / (individual pairs) TP**
- Braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
- Foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP
---
## Direct burial STP
**Overhead cable isn't always a good option**
- put the cable in the ground 

**Provides protection from the elements**
- Designed to be waterproof
- Often filled with gel to repel water 
- Conduit may not be needed 

**Shielded twisted pair**
- provides grounding 
- adds strength 
- protects against signal interference
