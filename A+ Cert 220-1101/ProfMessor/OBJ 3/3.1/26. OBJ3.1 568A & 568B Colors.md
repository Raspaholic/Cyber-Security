## Structured cabling standards
**International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards**
- defines classes of networking standards 

**Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)**
- Standards, market analysis, trade shows, government affairs, etc
- ANSI/TIA-568: Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard 
- http://www.tiaonline.org

**Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling**
- T568A & T568B
---
## T568A & T568B termination
**Pin assignments from T568-B standard**
- Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling 

**T568A & T568B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors**
- assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling 

**Many organizations traditionally use 568B**
- difficult to change mid-stream 

**You can't terminate 1 side of the cable with 568A and the other with 568B**
- this has never been the definition of a Gigabit Ethernet crossover cable
