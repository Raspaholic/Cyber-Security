## The SCSI standard 
**Small Computer Systems Interface**
- not really "small" any longer 

**Originally designed to string many peripherals together onto a single cable/controller**
- up to 16 devices in a SCSI "chain"

**Many different formats**
- Fast SCSI, Ultra SCSI, Ultra Wide SCSI, Ultra2 SCSI, Ultra3 SCSI, Ultra-320 SCSI, Ultra-640 SCSI, iSCSI (SCSI over IP)

**Parallel and serial options**

---
## SCSI advantages
**Not just for hard drives**
- Scanners, tape drives, CD-ROM drives 

**Many devices on a single bus**
- 8 on narrow bus, 16 on wide bus

**Very intelligent interface functionality**
- much of the difficult configuration work is done between the SCSI devices 

**Industry longevity**
- well supported in the enterprise
- a standard drive for virtual systems

## SCSI ID and Logical Unit (LUN)
**Every SCSI device on a single bus is assigned a separate ID number**
- SCSI ID 0 (SCSI controller), ID 2 (hard drive), ID 3 (CD-ROM)

**Logical Units (LUNs) are defined within each SCSI ID**
- Separate drives in a storage array or virtual machine 

**The signal at the "end" of a physical SCSI bus is terminated**
- can be internal to the device or a separate termination device 

**Serial attached SCSI (SAS) devices have no jumpers, terminators, or settings**

## Serial attached SCSI
**Move from parallel to serial**
- increased throughput 
- similar to the move from PATA to SATA 

**Point-to-point connection**
- no more daisy chains 

**No termination required**
- the bus has 2 devices on it

**The control and management of SCSI**
- the speed of a serial connection
