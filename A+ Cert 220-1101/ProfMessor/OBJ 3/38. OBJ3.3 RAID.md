## Data redundancy
**Hard drives store huge amounts of data**
- important data

**Hard drives are moving components**
- they will eventually break 

**What happens to the data when the drive fails?**
- you can prepare for this
- use an array of drives (multiple)

**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">RAID is not a backup</span>**
- this is not a copy of our data -- it IS the data we're actively retrieving or storing
- RAID is not a method of backup 
	- it's a way to maintain uptime and availability if 1 drive fails

## RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
**Redundant Array of Independent Disks**
- they're also inexpensive disks 

**Different RAID levels**
- some redundant, some not
---
## RAID 0 - Striping
**File blocks are split between 2 or more physical drives**

**High performance**
- data written quickly

**No redundancy**
- a drive failure breaks the array 
- RAID 0 is zero redundancy

## RAID 1 - Mirroring
**File blocks are duplicated between 2 or more physical drives**

**High disk utilization**
- EVERY file is duplicated 
- required disk space is DOUBLED 2x

**High redundancy**
- drive failure does not affect data availability

## RAID 5 - Striping with parity
**File blocks are striped**
- along with a parity block 
- requires at least 3 disks 

**Efficient use of disk space**
- files aren't duplicated, but space is still used for parity 

**High redundancy**
- data is available after drive failure 
- parity calculation may affect performance

## RAID 10 (1+0) - A stripe of mirrors 
**The speed of striping, the redundancy of mirroring**
- the best of both worlds 

**Need at least 4 drives**
