## WARNING
**Always disconnect from the power source when working on a device**
- always, seriously.

**Some devices store a charge in capacitors**
- know how to discharge before touching

**Never connect your body to any part of an electrical system**
- do not connect yourself to the ground wire of an electrical system 

**Respect electricity**
- it doesn't respect you

## Computer Power Supply
**Computer uses DC voltage**
- most power sources provide AC voltage 

**Convert 120 V AC or 240 V AC**
- to 3.3 V DC, 5 V DC, and 12 V DC

**You'll know when this isn't working**
- an important component

## Amp and Volt 
**Ampere (amp, A) - The rate of electron flow past a point in 1 second**
- the diameter of the hose 

**Voltage (volt, V) Electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons**
- How open the faucet is

## Power 
**Watt (W) - Measurement of real power use**
- volts *x* amps = watts
- 120V *x* 0.5A = 60W

## Current
**Alternating current (AC)**
- Direction of current constantly reverses
- Distributes electricity efficiently over long distances
- Frequency of this cycle is important 
	- US/Canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
	- Europe - 220-240 VAC, 50 Hz

**Direct current (DC)**
- Current moves in one direction with a constant voltage

## Dual-voltage input options
**Voltage varies by country**
- US/Canada - 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 hertz (Hz)
- Europe - 230 VAC, 50 Hz

**Manually switch between 120 V and 230 V**
- get your meter!
- or use an auto-switching power supply 

**Don't plug a 120 V power supply into a 230 V power source!!!!**

## Power supply output 
**Different voltages**
- for different components

**Positive and negative voltage**
- voltage is a difference in potential
- the electrical ground is a common reference point 
- depends on where you measure from 

**At the front door of your house**
- the second floor is +10 feet
- the basement is -10 feet 

**+12 V**
- PCIe adapters, hard drive motors, cooling fans, most modern components 

**+5 V**
- some motherboard components 
- many components are now using +3.3 V

**+3.3 V**
- M.2 slots, RAM slots, motherboard logic circuits

**+5 VSB**
- Standby voltage 

**-12 V**
- Integrated LAN
- older serial ports 
- some PCI cards 

**-5 V**
- available for ISA adapter cards 
- most cards didn't use it 
- today's motherboards don't have ISA slots

---
## 24-pin motherboard power 
**Main motherboard power**
- provides +3.3 V, +/-5 V, and +/- 12 V

**20 pin connector was the original ATX standard**
- 24 pin was added for PCI Express power 

**You can connect a 24-pin connector to a 20-pin motherboard**
- some cables are 20-pin + 4-pin 
---
## Redundant power supplies 
**2 (or more) power supplies**
- internal to the server 

**Each power supply can handle 100% of the load**
- would normally run at 50% of the load

**Hot-swappable**
- Replace a faulty power supply without powering down
![[Pasted image 20250713155955.png]]

---
## Power supply connectors
**Fixed connectors**
- connected to the power supply 
- may have too many connectors 
- may not have enough 

**Modular**
- add cables as needed 
- fewer leftover wires, better airflow
- a bit more expensive

## Sizing a Power Supply 
**Power supplies are rated by watts**
- overall and by individual voltages 

**Bigger isn't necessarily better**
- more expensive 
- doesn't speed up your computer 

**Physical size is relatively standard**
- older cases and systems may have proprietary sizes 

**Calculate the watts required for all components**
- CPU, storage devices, video adapter 
- Many online calculators

**Video adapters are usually the largest power draw**
- many video card specifications list a recommended power supply wattage 

**50% capacity is a good rule of thumb**
- power supply runs efficiently and there's room to grow
