## What is memory?
**Random Access Memory (RAM) is the most common**
- But it's not the only kind of memory 

**RAM is not referring to hard drive or SSD storage**
- don't mix the two terms 
- Data is stored permanently on the drive 

**Data and programs can only be used when moved to RAM**

## RAM (Random Access Memory) slots
**Memory types have changed through the years**
- driven by standardization and technology 

**One of the most important components of your computer**
- Speed, speed, speed 

**Every motherboard is different**
- Check your documentation

## DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)
**DIMM**
- Dual Inline Memory Module 
- Electrical contacts are different on each side 
**64 bit data width**

## SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module)
**Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module**
- About half the width as a DIMM

**Used in laptops and mobile devices**

## Dynamic Random Access Memory
**The memory on the DIMM**

**Dynamic**
- Needs constant refreshing
- Without refreshing, the data in memory disappears 

**Random access**
- any storage location can be accessed directly
- unlike magnetic tape

## SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM
**Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)**

**SDRAM is synchronous with the common system clock**
- Queue up one process while waiting for another 
- Classic DRAM didn't wait for a clock signal

## SDR vs DDR
![[Pasted image 20250706192628.png]]

---
## Double Data Rate 3 (DDR3) SDRAM 
**Twice the data rate of DDR2**
- larger chip capacities - Maximum 16 GB per DIMM

**No backwards compatibility**
- Speed brings sacrifice

---
## Double Data Rate 4 (DDR4) SDRAM 
**Speed increases over DDR3**
- faster frequencies 
- Maximum 64 GB per DIMM
- NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY 
![[Pasted image 20250706192854.png]]

---
## Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) SDRAM 
**Faster data transfers between the memory module and motherboard**
- maximum of 64 GB per DIMM

**The key has moved**
- No backwards compatibility
