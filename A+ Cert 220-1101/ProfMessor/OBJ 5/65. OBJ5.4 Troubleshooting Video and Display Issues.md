## No video image
**Is it connected?**
- wouldn't ask if it wasn't a real solution
- check both power and signal cable 

**Input selection on monitor**
- HDMI
- DVI
- VGA, etc

**Image is dim**
- check brightness controls 

**Swap the monitor**
- try the monitor on another computer 

**No video after windows loads**
- Use VGA mode (F8)

## Image quality problems
**Flickering, color patterns incorrect**
- you can almost work with this 

**Check the cable pins**
- especially if missing a color 

**Distorted image and geometry**
- check the OS refresh rate and resolution settings 
- Need to match the display specifications
- Check or replace cable 

**Disable hardware acceleration**
- troubleshoot with the software drivers 
---
## Native resolution
**An LCD display is fixed**
- the number of pixels doesn't change 

**A display looks best when the video settings match a display's native resolution**
- a mismatch can cause distortion

**If changing the display resolution, try using a multiple of the native resolution**
- 2560 x 1600 is the same ratio as 1920 x 1200

## Burn-in 
**A problem across all monitor types**
- some displays will pixel-shift
- you probably won't notice it

**LCDs have "image sticking"**
- try to remove by displaying a white screen for an extended period

## Dead pixels 
**Always black**
- a manufacturing defect

**This probably isn't a problem on your side**
- not a cable or power issue 

**Clean the monitor screen**
- damp cloth

**You'll have to replace the monitor**
- no other option

## LCD projector troubleshooting 
**Large screen projection**
- conference rooms, large gatherings 

**Not always LCD**
- but common to see LCD

**Metal-halide lamp**
- very bright (very hot) light 
- relatively expensive 
- (~ $35 to $350+ US)

**Always let bulbs cool**
- fan will run after shutting off
- keep it plugged in

**Intermittent projector shutdown**
- No light output 
- Fans may continue to run 

**Cooling issue**
- fans constantly cool the bulb 
- shuts down if temperatures are high 

**Check the airflow**
- remove any blockages 
- clean dust from the air filters and external air input/output
