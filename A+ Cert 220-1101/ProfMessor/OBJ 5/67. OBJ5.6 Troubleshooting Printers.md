## Multiple prints pending in queue

## Incorrect color settings 
**The output colors aren't the same as the display**
- Important for publishing and color printing 

**Calibrate the monitor**

**Check the paper**

**Calibrate the printer**
- the proper amount of ink and toner

## Grinding noises 
**Never a good sound from your printer**
- the ink is already manufactured

**Something is not operating properly**
- paper jam 
- carriage is stalled or jammed 

**Each printer has a different process**
- check the manuals for removing paper jams 
- some inkjet printers have a particular process 

**May require additional maintenance**
- or replace the printer

## Finishing issues 
**Finishing happens after the ink or toner has been applied**
- Collate, binding, etc

**Staple jams**
- larger printers will collate and staple groups of papers 
- each printer manufacturer has a different removal process 

**Incorrect hole punch location**
- verify with the printer driver 
- may require a driver update 
---
## Incorrect page orientation 
**Print a portrait page**
- get a landscape print 

**Check the settings when printing**
- controlled by the print driver 
- may require a driver update 

**The printer also has a default setting**
