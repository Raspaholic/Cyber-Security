## No network connectivity 
**Do you have a link light?**
- is it plugged in?

**Ping loopback (127.0.0.1)**
- is the protocol stack working?
- availability and intermittent connectivity 

**Ping local IP address**
- checks local configuration, adapter, and link signal

**Ping default gateway**
- connectivity on the local network 

**Ping devices on router's other side**
- 8.8.8.8 or 9.9.9.9
---
## Intermittent wireless connectivity 
**Interference**
- something else is using our frequency 

**Signal strength**
- transmitting signal, transmitting antenna, receiving antenna, etc

**Incorrect channel**
- usually automatic; look for manual tuning 

**Bounce and latency**
- Multipath interference; flat surfaces

**Incorrect access point placement**
- Locate close to the users 
---
## Wireless interference 
**Predictable**
- Fluorescent lights 
- Microwave ovens
- Cordless telephones
- High-power sources 

**Unpredictable**
- Multi-tenant building 

**Measurements**
- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Performance Monitor

## Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
**Signal**
- what you want

**Noise**
- what you don't want
- interference from other networks and devices 

**You want a very large ratio**
- the same amount of signal to noise (1:1) would be bad

## Limited or no connectivity 
**Windows alert in the system tray**
- "Limited or No connectivity"
- "No Internet Access"

**Check the local IP address**
- an APIPA address will only have local connectivity

**If DHCP address is obtained, perform the ping tests**
- Local gateway, remote IP address 
---
## Jitter
**Most real-time media is sensitive to delay**
- data should arrive at regular intervals
- Voice communication, live video

**If you miss a packet, there's no retransmission**
- there's no time to "rewind" your phone call 

**Jitter is the time between frames**
- Excessive jitter can cause you to miss information, "choppy" voice calls

## Poor VoIP quality 
**High speed and low latency**
- Real-time applications are demanding

**Check the internet connection**
- a speed test can identify slow links

**Verify the local networking equipment**
- an old router can cause significant problems

**View the network performance**
- a packet capture would be useful

---
## Latency 
**A delay between the request and the response**
- waiting time

**Some latency is expected and normal**
- laws of physics apply 

**Examine the response times at every step along the way**
- this may require multiple measurement tools 

**Packet captures can provide detailed analysis**
- Microsecond granularity
- Get captures from both sides 
---
## Port flapping
**Network interface goes up and down**
- over and over again

**Verify the cable**
- check the wiring 

**Move between switch interfaces**
- is the flapping associated with the switch interface or the device?

**Replace bad hardware or cables**
- may require additional purchases
