## Storage failure symptoms
**Read/write failure**
- "cannot read from the source disk"

**Slow performance**
- constant LED activity
- Retry...retry...retry

**Loud clicking noise**
- The click of death 
- May also include grinding and scraping 
---
## Troubleshooting disk failures 
**Get a backup**
- first thing - a bad drive is BAD

**Check for loose or damaged cables**

**Check for overheating**
- especially if problems occur after startup

**Check power supply**
- especially if new devices were added 

**Run hard drive diagnostics**
- from the drive or computer manufacturer
- preferably on a known-good computer 
---
## Boot failure symptoms 
**Drive not recognized, Boot Device Not Found**
- Lights (or no lights)
- beeps 
- Error messages 

**Operating System not found**
- the drive is there 
- Windows is not on that drive 
---
## Troubleshooting boot failures 
**Check your cables**
- physical problem 

**Check boot sequence in BIOS**
- check for removable disks (especially in USB)
- check for disabled storage interfaces

**For new installation, check hardware configuration**
- data and power cables 
- try different SATA interfaces 

**Try the drive in a different computer**

---
## Data loss/corruption
**Hard drives are mechanical devices**
- they will eventually fail 

**Repairs are difficult and expensive**
- Dust-free environment
- not always successful

**An SSD may simply stop working**
- sometimes can read but not write 

**Data becomes unavailable or corrupted**
- can be impossible to recover 

**ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP**

---
## RAID not found 
**Missing or faulty RAID controller**

---
## RAID stops working 
**Each RAID is different**
- don't start pulling drives until you check the console!

## S.M.A.R.T
**Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology**
- use third party utilities

**Avoid hardware failure**
- look for warning signs 

**Schedule disk checks**
- built-in to most drive arrays 

**Warning signs**
- replace a drive

## Extended read/write times
**A lot happens when reading or writing data**
- Memory access
- communication across the bus
- spinning drive access 
- writing or reading the data to the storage device, etc

**Delays can occur anywhere along the way**
- need a way to measure storage device access 

**Input/output operations per second (IOPS)**
- a broad metric of maximum performance 

**Useful for comparing storage devices**
- Hard drive: 200 IOPS
- SSD: 1,000,000 IOPS

## Missing drives in OS
**OS boots normally**
- other drives not shown
- check the BIOS

**Internal drives**
- bad drive or disconnected cable 

**External drives**
- no power to the drive or bad cable connection 

**Network shares**
- shared drives can be connected during startup 
- option to reconnect at sign-in
- connected with login script
