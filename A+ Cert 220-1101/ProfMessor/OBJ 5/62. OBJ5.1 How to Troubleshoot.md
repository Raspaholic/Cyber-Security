## Change management 
**Change control**
- a formal process for managing change 
- avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
- corporate policy and procedures

**Nothing changes without the process**
- plan for a change 
- estimate the risk associated with change 
- have a recovery plan if the change doesn't work 
- test before making the change 
- document all of this and get approval
- make the change

## The troubleshooting process 
![[Pasted image 20250715132030.png]]

---
## 1 Identify the problem
**Information gathering**
- get as many details as possible 
- duplicate the issue, if possible 

**Identify symptoms**
- may be more than a single symptom 

**Question users**
- your best source of details 

**Determine if anything has changed**
- who's in the wiring closet?

**Approach multiple problems individually**

**Backup everything**
- you're going to make some changes 
- you should always have a rollback plan

**What else has changed?**
- the user may not be aware 
- environmental changes 
- infrastructure changes 

**There may be some clues**
- check OS log files 
- applications may have log information 
---
## 2 Establish a theory
**Start with the obvious**
- Occam's razor applies 

**Consider everything**
- even the not-so-obvious 

**Make a list of all possible causes**
- start with the easy theories
- and the least difficult to test 

**Research the symptoms**
- internal knowledgebase 
- Google searches
---
## 3 Test the theory 
**Confirm the theory**
- determine the next steps to resolve problem 

**Theory didn't work?**
- re-establish new theory or escalate 
- call an expert

**The theory worked!**
- make a plan 
---
## 4 Create a plan of action 
**Build the plan**
- correct the issue with a minimum of impact 

**Refer to vendor instructions**
- knowledge base, support articles
- documentation and manuals

**Identify potential effects**
- every plan can go bad
- have a plan B
- and a plan C
---
## 5 Implement the solution
**Fix the issue**
- implement during the change control window 

**Escalate as necessary**
- you may need help from a 3rd party
---
## 6 Verify full system functionality
**It's not fixed until it's REALLY fixed**
- the test should be PART of your plan
- have your customer confirm the fix 

**Implement preventative measures**
- let's avoid this issue in the future
---
## 7 Document findings
**It's not over until you build the knowledge base**
- don't lose valuable knowledge!

**What action did you take?**
- what outcome did it have?

**Consider a formal database**
- help desk case notes 
- searchable database
