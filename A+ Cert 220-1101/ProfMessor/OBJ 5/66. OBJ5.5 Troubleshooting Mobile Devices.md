- remove any obstructions

**Check the cable**
- don't use frayed or damaged cables 
- try a known-good cable

## Poor or no connectivity
**Cellular or WiFi**
- location, location, location 

**Cellular**
- signal strength
- location matters 
- outdoor connectivity may be better 

**WiFi**
- limited range 
- interference can limit throughput 
- may need a channel/frequency configuration change

## Liquid damage 
**Many phones have a Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI)**
- turns color when liquid has been present 

**Power down the phone**
- don't power it back on. DONT DO IT

**Remove the case, cards, back, and battery**

- don't charge the phone 
- don't connect it to power 
- don't press any keys 
- don't heat the phone 
- don't move it around

- hope for the best

## Overheating 
**Phone will automatically shut down**

**Rough handling and accidents**
- damages the interface 

**Not charging**

## Malware
**Always a concern**
- even on mobile devices 
- the device type doesn't matter 

**Look for symptoms**
- unusual apps 
- large data transfers 
- pop up messages

## Cursor drift 
**Random input or cursor moves without touching the device**
