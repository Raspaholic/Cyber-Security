## POST (Power On Self Test)
**Test major system components before booting the OS**
- main systems (CPU, CMOS, etc)
- video
- memory

**Failures are usually noted with beeps and/or codes**
- BIOS versions can differ, check your documentation

**Don't bother memorizing the beep codes.**
- they're all different between manufacturers
- know WHAT to do when you hear them
---
## POST and boot 
**Blank screen on boot**
- listen for beeps 
- bad video, bad RAM, bad CPU
- BIOS configuration issue

**BIOS time and setting**
- maintained with the motherboard battery
- replace the battery 

**Attempts to boot to incorrect device**
- set boot order in BIOS configuration 
- confirm that the startup device has a valid OS
- check for media in a startup device 
---
## Crash screens 
**Windows Stop Error**

**Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**
- you don't want this 

**Contains important information**
- also written to event log 

**Useful when tracking down problems**
- sometimes more useful for manufacturer support

## Bluescreens and Spontaneous Shutdowns
**Startup and shutdown BSOD**
- bad hardware 
- bad drivers 
- bad application 

**Use Last Known Good, System Restore, or Rollback Driver**
- try Safe Mode 

**Reseat or remove the hardware**
- if possible 

**Run hardware diagnostics**
- provided by the manufacturer 
- BIOS may have hardware diagnostics 
---
## The spinning ball of death 
**The macOS X Spinning Wait Cursor**
- feedback that something is happening
- like windows Spinning Blue Ring Cursor 

**The spin starts, but it NEVER STOPS!**
- you never get back control of your computer 

**Many possible reasons**
- application bug
- bad hardware 
- slow paging to disk 

**Restart the computer**
- there may be details in the console logs

---
## Black screen 
**Is the monitor connected?**
- we wouldn't ask if it wasn't a common solution 
- check both power and signal cable

**Input selection on monitor**
- HDMI
- DVI 
- VGA, etc

**Image is dim**
- check brightness controls

**Swap the monitor**
- try the monitor on another computer 

**No video after Windows loads**
- use VGA mode (F8)

---
## No power 
**No power**
- no power at the source 
- no power from the power supply 
- get out your multimeter (in pic - different kind)

**Fans spin - no power to the other devices**
- Where is your fan connected?
- No POST - bad motherboard?
- Case fans have lower voltage requirements 
- check the power supply output

---
## Sluggish performance
**Task Manager**
- check for high CPU utilization and I/O

**Windows Update**
- latest patches and drivers 

**Disk space**
- check for available space and defrag

**Laptops may be using power-saving mode**
- Throttles the CPU

**Anti-virus and anti-malware**
- scan for bad guys 
---
## Overheating
**Heat generation**
- CPUs, video adapters, memory 

**Cooling systems**
- fans and airflow 
- heat sinks 
- clean and clear 

**Verify with monitoring software**
- built into the BIOS
- Try HWMonitor

## Smoke and burning smell 
**Electrical problems**
- the smoke makes everything work 

**Always disconnect power**
- there should never be a burned odor 

**Locate bad components**
- even after the system has cooled down
- replace all damaged components 
---
## Intermittent shutdown 
**No warning, black screen**
- may have some details in your Event Viewer

**Heat-related issue**
- High CPU or graphics, gaming 
- check all fans and heat sinks 
- BIOS may show fan status and temperatures 

**Failing hardware**
- has anything changed?
- check Device Manager, run diagnostics 

**Could be anything**
- eliminate what's working 
---
## Application crashes 
**Application stops working**
- may provide an error message 
- may just disappear 

**Check the Event Log**
- often includes useful reconnaissance

**Check the Reliability Monitor**
- a history of application problems 
- checks for resolutions

**Reinstall the application**
- contact application support

## Grinding noises 
**Computers should hum**
- not grind 

**Rattling**
- loose components 

**Scraping**
- hard drive issues 

**Clicking**
- fan problems 

**Pop**
- blown capacitor 
![[Pasted image 20250715140115.png]]

---
## Lockups
**System completely stops**
- Completely. Usually not much in the event log
- similar to unexpected shutdowns 

**Check for any activity**
- hard drive, status lights, try Ctrl-Alt-Del

**Update drivers and software patches**
- has this been done recently?

**Low resources**
- RAM, storage 

**Hardware diagnostics may be helpful**

---
## Continuous reboots 
**How far does the boot go before rebooting?**
- BIOS only? OS splash screen?

**Bad driver or configuration**
- F8
- "Boot from last known working configuration"

**Try F8, Safe Mode**
- if system starts, disable automatic restarts in System Properties 

**Bad hardware**
- try removing or replacing devices 
![[Pasted image 20250715140513.png]]

---
## Inaccurate system date/time
**Bad motherboard battery**
- often a "button" style battery 

**A bad battery will require a BIOS configuration or date/time configuration on every boot**

**On older systems, can reset the BIOS configuration by removing the battery**
- Newer computers use a jumper
