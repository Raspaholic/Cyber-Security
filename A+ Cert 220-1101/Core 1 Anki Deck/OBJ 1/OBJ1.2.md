START
Basic
Organic LED (OLED)
Back:
- Each pixel has its own separate LED that provides the light 
- OLEDs can be made from plastic 
- OLEDs can be folded, rolled up, or manipulated to create different shapes and sizes of displays

Basic
WiFi Placement
Back:
- strategically placed along outer edges, near top or side of the screen or within bezel 
	- avoids interference from internal components 
	- provides best signal strength w/o interference from metal components or the user 
Tags: OBJ1.2, WiFi_Placement
<!--ID: 1730838264415-->

START
Basic
WiFi Connector 
Back:
- connects antenna to motherboard 
- usually small, coaxial-type connector
	- enables wireless signal transmission for data/internet access 
Tags: OBJ1.2, WiFi_CX

START
Basic
Camera (Rear Facing)
Back:
- most mobile devices have rear and front facing cameras
- often highest quality camera on device being rear 
- includes lenses, img sensors, multiple cameras for wide-angle, zoom, macro in depth
- quality depends on resolution(megapixels), sensor size, software processing
Tags: OBJ1.2, Camera_Rear
<!--ID: 1730838317404-->
END

START
Basic
Webcam (Front)
Back:
- generally lower quality compared to phones and rear cameras 
- used for video calls, selfies, facial recognition
- mobile ones often embedded just above the display
Tags: OBJ1.2, Webcam_Front
<!--ID: 1730838341878-->
END

START
Basic
Lens: focuses light onto image sensor 
Img Sensor: converts light into electrical signals, producing digital image 
Img Processing Chip: enhances img by adjusting colors, exposure, noise reduction
Back: camera

START
Basic
Microphone
Back:
- often located near bottom/back of device 
- high-end devices might have multiple for better sound quality (noise cancellation & stereo recording) 
- converts sound waves into electrical signals 
Tags: OBJ1.2, Microphone
<!--ID: 1730838389114-->

START
Basic
Touchscreen
Back:
2 types
Resistive Touchscreen: uses pressure on 2 layers to register a touch 
- not as common in modern smartphones 
Capacitive Touchscreen: uses electrical properties of human body to detect touch 
- standard in most smartphones 
- supports multi-touch gestures 
- more responsive and offers durable surface 

- allows user to interact with what's on the screen 
	- typing, swiping, zooming
Tags: OBJ1.2, Touchscreen
<!--ID: 1730838408132-->
END

START
Basic
Digitizer
Back:
- responsible for detecting input
- converts physical touch gestures into digital signals the OS interprets 
Tags: OBJ1.2, Digitizer
<!--ID: 1730838422645-->
END

START
Basic
Inverter
Back:
- primarily for LCD displays 
- a component used in older LCD displays to power the backlight 
- converts DC (Direct Current) power from the battery into AC (Alternating Current) power needed to light up screen's fluorescent backlight 
Tags: OBJ1.2, Inverter
<!--ID: 1730838438053-->
END

START
Basic
Inverter Relevance
Back:
- modern smartphones using OLED/AMOLED displays don't require inverter, each pixel emits its own light 
- older devices/devices with LCD screens, plays crucial role in maintaining screen brightness 
- faulty one can lead to dim/flickering
