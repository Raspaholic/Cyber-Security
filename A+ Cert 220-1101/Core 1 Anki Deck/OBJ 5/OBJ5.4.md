- display resolution may not match the native resolution of the monitor/projector 
- for projectors: improper focus can lead to fuzziness 
- adjust output resolution to match the display's native resolution 
- projectors: adjust the focus ring until the image is sharp

Flashing Screens
Back:
- flashing screen means the cable isn't properly connected 
- faulty cable connections or incorrect refresh rates can cause flashing 
- reconnect or replace the cable
- ensure refresh rate is set to the display's supported value in the display settings

Dead Pixels
Back:
- there's no fix 
- damage or defects to the display can result in dead/stuck pixels 
- gently massaging the area or using software utilities to cycle colors may help revive stuck pixels 
- dead pixels usually require a screen replacement

END

START
Basic
Standards Mismatch
Back:
- intermittent wireless connectivity: connected or disconnected network 
- Intermittent wired connectivity: upstate to downstate of switch port 

- Signal interference is causing signal issues 
- Channels 1, 6, and 11 spread out the network and avoid interference 
- Wireless a, n, ac, and ax are less prone to signal interference

RSSI displayed in negative dB's
Back:
- increase the power of transmission
- increase the antenna size 
- move closer to the source 
- wireless a, n, ac, and ax 5 GHz
- wireless b, g, or n 2.4 GHz

- What frequency is being used?
- what is the maximum speed of that frequency?
- which versions of wireless networking are being used?
- configure the wireless access points to support the modern versions of the protocols
