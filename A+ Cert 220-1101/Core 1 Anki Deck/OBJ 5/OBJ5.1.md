TARGET DECK: A+ Core 1::5.1 Apply Best Practice Methodology to Solve Problems

START
Basic
1 Identify the Problem
Back:
1. Gather info from the user
2. Identify user changes
3. Perform backups before making any changes 
4. Ask about any environmental or infrastructure changes made recently
What happened?
What was the status before?
What is the status after that?
Are there any changes in the system?

- [ ] immediately question anything obvious or easy to check 
- [ ] conduct external or internal research based on symptoms

3 Test the Theory to Determine the Cause
Back:
- [ ] theory confirmed: determine next steps to resolve the problem 
- [ ] if theory isn't confirmed: re-establish a new theory or escalate

- [ ] Theory is confirmed 
- [ ] Theory is not confirmed 
- [ ] Lack skills of authority 
- [ ] unable to solve 
- [ ] escalate when there is an issue

4 Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve Problem and Implement the Solution
Back:
- [ ] refer to the vendor's instructions for guidance 

**Repair** 
**Replace** 
**Workaround** 
**How many are the resources?** 
**How much time does it take?** 
**How much is the cost?** 
**Impact on the users and system?** 
**<u>A change of plan needs to get the authorization again</u>**

5 Verify Full System Functionality | Implement Preventative Measures
Back:
- [ ] 1. check system full functionality 
      
- [ ] 2. implement preventative measures  

- [ ] Identify the problem 
- [ ] Establish a theory 
- [ ] Test the theory 
- [ ] Establish a plan of action 
- [ ] Verify system functionality 
- [ ] Check the problem has been solved 
- [ ] Inspect the other components to ensure nothing else is damaged, broken, or disconnected
- [ ] Check the logs and diagnostic tools to confirm everything is working as they should
