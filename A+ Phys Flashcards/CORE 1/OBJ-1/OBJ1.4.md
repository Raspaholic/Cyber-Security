GSM vs CDMA
Back:
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)
	- widely used around world esp Europe & Asia 
	- Uses SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards, stores user info allows users switch devices easily
	- networks generally more open to roaming, allowing users to use devices in different regions 

Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
	- primarily used in US by carriers like Verizon/Sprint 
	- doesn't use SIM cards; instead registers devices through carrier's network 
	- CDMA provides better security and call quality 
		- less flexible for roaming internationally

Preferred Roaming List (PRL) Updates
Back:
- a database that contains list of carriers and their corresponding frequencies mobile devices should prioritize when connecting to networks outside home network
	-relevant for CDMA-based devices 
- ensures mobile devices connect to most suitable network when user is roaming (using another carriers network) 
	- helps in maintaining call quality, data speeds, overall connectivity outside home service 
- device scans available networks, references the PRL to determine which networks to connect to first based on pre-defined priorities 
	- PRL includes info: carrier ID (network names/codes), Frequency Bands, info whether network supports voice data or both 
- manual PRL update: settings>network settings/about phone 
	- contains all the information about different cellular towers
	- restrictions vary from model to model and depends on the device's country of origin

Bluetooth
Back:
Enabling Bluetooth:
- turn on Bluetooth in device's settings 
- typically found under Connections & Wireless & Networks 
- allows device to discover & connect to Bluetooth-enabled accessories 
Enabling Pairing:
- devices must be in pairing mode 
Find Device for Pairing: 
- automatically scans for devices once Bluetooth is enabled 
Enter appropriate PIN code: 
- many Bluetooth devices require PIN code for pairing, usually default code

- Geo-Tracking:
	- tracking of a location for a given amount of time
	- disable GPS and IPS to block geo-tracking 
	- geotagging is the GPS coordinates inside photos
- Cellular Location Services:
	- utilize various ones to determine location 
	- users can enable/disable location through settings under Privacy or Location
